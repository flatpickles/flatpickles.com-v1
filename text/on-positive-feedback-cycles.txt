On Positive Feedback Cycles
-------

Life is a positive feedback cycle. A tree routes nutrients to the extremities that generate the most energy, developing a structure that both represents the paths it's taken in its growth, and supports further developments. A similar process drives species evolution, and behavioral adaptation. I love this as a metaphor for personal development, and I may continue thinking of myself as a tree-like being: growing towards the things that give me energy, and therein forming the structure of my larger being.
