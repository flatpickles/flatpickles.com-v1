Retiring flatpickles.com v1
-------

This note is the final project that I'll post on flatpickles.com v1, and it's also the only project which will *not* be available on the next version. A dedicated goodbye of sorts.

I've been making personal websites for over two decades, but this is the first one that's felt sustainably consistent with who I am. This feeling comes both from within and without – I see myself in this design, as do the friends who have kindly complimented its aesthetic and intentions. The most salient thing I've learned from v1 is that having a space where I can post *everything* I make is extremely valuable to me. Bringing my whole self to the internet feels both validating and motivating, across the many dimensions of my creative self.

Perhaps it's silly to retire this website so soon, but I'm excited to explore a new design direction, and develop some expanded functionality. The minimalist technical design of v1 was very much intentional, and while v2 is more complex, I hope it will preserve the positive aspects of a minimal aesthetic, while also improving upon the UX and publishing experience.

Above all, flatpickles.com is a tool I will continue using to figure out who I am, and what I want to put out into the world. Self-presentation and self-determination are deeply interrelated projects, and I feel blessed to be making progress in both.

As always, thanks for visiting, reading, and being you!

With love,
-Matt
